Simplenote, a. . well, simple way to take notes!

<em>This review is part of a weekly series on productivity applications for iPhone</em>

Simplenote. The name describes what it does.

It takes notes simply, and it does them well. It is ad-supported, but you can buy a premium twelve month subscription to the tune of
$19.99/year, or $1.99/month (USD). 

You can search your notes, you can tag them, and you can use their pretty nifty webapp to view and edit them on your computer.

There you can share your notes (but sadly not with collaborators), and it's actually a pretty nice little application. 

Recommended for: Those who just want simple note taking, with no frills.
