Editorial: Skype, MicroSkype and SkypeSoft.


Well, isn't this dandy. Today, it was announced that Microsoft bought Skype to the tune of $8.5 Billion USD. That's a lot.

And to be honest, Microsoft can have Skype. Here's why though.

Skype is bad. Unless you're on Windows.

The Mac and Linux clients are rather. . . lets just say lacking in some areas.
However, if you're on Windows (Which the majority of our readers are), then Skype is great. However, Skypes current plan is this:

If you want to do video calling with one person, that's OK. More than one? It's going to cost you. **However**, I digress. 

Skype just isn't worth it anymore. They've got issues with their mobile clients[1], [2], and they've got issues with their desktop clients.[3]

But then there's this big thing that is normally used to describe Android.

It's called "Fragmentation". 

And when I say "Fragmentation", I mean "Fragmentation". 

Here's what I mean by that. 

Skype for Windows version: 5.3

Skype for Linux: 2.2 *Beta*

Skype for Mac: 5.1

See the problem here? *There is no common version*. And that's a big problem. 

So, what's the future of Skype now that it's part of the Behemoth in Redmond, WA? I don't know.
But I do know this: It isn't going to be pretty. 

And not to be the doom and gloom guy, but honestly, I see nothing but bad news down the MicroSkypeâ„¢ trail.
