Wunderlist, A Nice, Pretty Shiny Todo Application [REVIEW]

<em> This is a part of a multi-part series on productivity applications for iOS</em>

As you might have seen last week, we had a review of <em>Todo</em> for iOS.

This week, I'll be rewiewing Wunderlist, another iOS Application for Getting Things Done. 

Wunderlist is a neat, free, lightweight Application that is worth at least a look at. 

You create an account in the app for Wunderlist.com, their syncing service. Sync is fast, free and reliable. 

It's lacking in features, but what it's lacking in features (namely, repeating tasks), it makes up in looks. 

Wunderlist has a amazing interface that is very streamlined and simple, which is precisely what you want in a productivity application.

The app gives you a choice between several different backgrounds, and each to-do list is in black and white, which is nice.

Each tab shows the number of tasks to do in a little number. 
You can setup Wunderlist to remind you to do that task at a certain time, and that's nice.

Another neat thing about Wunderlist is that you get an email address that you can email a task, and then it'll add it to Wunderlist sync.
Here's a few screenshots to take a look at.

In all, if you're looking for a free todo list, Wunderlist is worth a look.

Wunderlist: Free on the AppStore.
