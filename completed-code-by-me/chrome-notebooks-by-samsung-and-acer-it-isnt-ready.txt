Chrome Notebooks By Samsung and Acer: It isn't ready


For those of you that don't know, today at Google I/O (The annual Google Developer conference) it was announced that there would be some "Chrome Notebooks" made by Samsung and Acer shipping on June 15th - and while that's all nice and dandy, it's not ready yet. 

Why do I say "it's not ready yet"? 

Because I've got a Cr-48. And here's how much I used it in the past week.

4 hours.

Now here you're going to say "Well Mr. Gifford, if you're not using your Cr-48, then send it right this way!" 

However, I'd have to ask you "Once the novelty wears off, will you actually use it?" - the answer is "Probably not". And heres why you probably won't use it anymore than I do.

Because it's still beta, it's raw, it's not ready for the average consumer, it's a first-gen product. Any one of them would be enough to make it a novelty. All four? It's really a novelty. 

At the moment, there is no offline Gmail, Google Docs, or anything else that would make it useful if you're not connected to the internet. And there aren't many (At least, I haven't found any) third-party applications that have offline capabilties. So at this point, I'd caution against getting one (And if I was at Google, I'd caution against releasing it. But I'm not with Google, despite this April Fools joke that a few of you might have seen!)

For the price (Which is about $400 USD according to sources), it's about $150 USD too much - however, I don't know if they'll be packaging a few months free 3G in there or not. If they do, then I'd say that it's about the right price. Again, that's just speculation.
