Evernote, The Mother Of All Note Taking Apps

Title says it all.

Ever wanted a full blown [Content Mangement System](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system) on your iPhone (or iPod touch)?

Evernote gives it to you.

Here's where evernote really shines:

You're out for a walk around town, and you see a new restruant that's opening next week, and they have a deal where if you're one of the first 200 customers, you get 20% off. 

You take out your iPhone, open Evernote, tap the "+" icon that means "New note", tap the "location" button, tap the "camera" button, snap a picture of the restruant, hit save, and <em>BOOM!</em> you're done!

So, when you get home, you can open up Evernote.com, select your new note, and then you'll have your geo-tagged note, complete with a photo of the offer.

You can also record voice memos as well.

If you're looking for the Swiss Army Knife of note applications for iPhone, you're depriving yourself if you don't give Evernote a go.

Minor (for most people, major for me): When you sync, the notes aren't saved for offline reading. Which means that for me and my workflow, Evernote isn't an option.

However, your usage may vary.
